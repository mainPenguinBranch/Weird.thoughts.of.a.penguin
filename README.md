Weird thoughts of a penguin 
Have you ever wondered what happened to your missing pets? Like… where they might be? Are they alive? Or was it all just acting?

Just imagine—what if your pets were actually spies for aliens? What if they were studying us all along? Would you believe it?

What if the cuddles were just a cover? Not cuddles… I mean missions.

What if their “disappearance” was just part of the act—to return to their spaceship and report everything?

Ever wonder what they’re saying when two cats, dogs, or other animals stare at each other in the street? What if they’re sharing information—covertly updating each other?

And why do they always look at you when you’re not looking?

Check right now—is your pet watching you?

BEWARE GUYS !!
Don’t let them know we’ve discovered their secret!!!

And I’m 100% sure your pet is with you right now… looking at your phone.

Don’t let them read this!!!

NOOO!!! There’s a cat outside my house—
He's staring at me.

OH MY GWAD—HE’S HERE TO KIDNAP MEEE!!!
(Screams. Disappears.)
